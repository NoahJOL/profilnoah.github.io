    <h2>An anecdote combining travel and pastry?</h2>
    <p>During a spontaneous escapade in Kyoto, I wandered through the winding alleys of Gion, the historic district, in search of authenticity far from the usual tourist circuits. My appetite for discovery led me to a small artisanal store selling wagashi, Japanese sweets that are as much works of art as they are delicacies. Driven by curiosity, I crossed the threshold and found myself immersed in a world of flavors and shapes inspired by nature. The master pastry chef, noticing my interest, offered me a demonstration of how to prepare nerikiri, a sweet bean paste shaped into ephemeral forms that evoke the seasons. This moment of sharing, where travel and pastry intertwined, transformed my visit into an unforgettable experience, a delicious reminder of Kyoto's cultural richness.</p>
